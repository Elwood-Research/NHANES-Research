## Hypothesis Testing Results

### Hypothesis 1: Chronic Conditions (CONFIRMED)
**Dose-response relationship between chronic conditions and poor physical health days:**

| Number of Chronic Conditions | Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR) | 95% Confidence Interval | p-value |
|------------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|---------|
| 1 Condition | 1.22 | 1.12 - 1.33 | <0.001 |
| 2 Conditions | 1.55 | 1.41 - 1.70 | <0.001 |
| 3+ Conditions | 2.08 | 1.89 - 2.29 | <0.001 |

**Key Statistic**: Men with 3 or more chronic conditions experienced **twice the rate** of poor physical health days compared to those without chronic conditions.

---

### Hypothesis 2: Mental Health Association (CONFIRMED)
- Mental health days were positively associated with physical health days
- The correlation between mental and physical health demonstrates the interconnected nature of psychological and physical well-being
- Each additional mentally unhealthy day was associated with increased physical health limitations

---

### Hypothesis 3: Socioeconomic Status (CONFIRMED)
**Income-to-Poverty Ratio (continuous):**
- IRR = 0.92 per unit increase (95% CI: 0.90-0.94)
- **Interpretation**: Each unit increase in income-to-poverty ratio associated with 8% reduction in poor physical health days
- p-value: <0.001

**Education (reference: Some college or higher):**
- Less than high school: IRR = 1.18 (95% CI: 1.09-1.28), p < 0.001
- High school diploma/GED: IRR = 1.08 (95% CI: 1.00-1.17), p = 0.047

**Key Statistic**: Men without a high school diploma experienced **18% higher rates** of poor physical health days compared to those with at least some college education.

---

### Hypothesis 4: Racial/Ethnic Disparities (CONFIRMED)
**Racial/Ethnic Differences (reference: Non-Hispanic White):**

| Racial/Ethnic Group | IRR | 95% CI | p-value |
|---------------------|-----|--------|---------|
| Mexican American | 1.43 | 1.30 - 1.57 | <0.001 |
| Non-Hispanic Black | 1.12 | 1.02 - 1.23 | 0.018 |
| Other Hispanic | 1.15 | 1.00 - 1.32 | 0.051 |
| Other/Multiracial | 1.03 | 0.87 - 1.22 | 0.72 |

**Key Statistic**: Mexican American men experienced **43% higher rates** of poor physical health days compared to non-Hispanic White men, even after adjusting for socioeconomic factors and chronic conditions.

---

### Hypothesis 5: Physical Activity Protection (CONFIRMED)
**Physical Activity Level (reference: Inactive):**

| Activity Level | IRR | 95% CI | p-value |
|----------------|-----|--------|---------|
| Low Activity | 0.91 | 0.84 - 0.99 | 0.028 |
| Moderate Activity | 0.85 | 0.78 - 0.92 | <0.001 |
| High Activity | 0.81 | 0.74 - 0.89 | <0.001 |

**Key Statistic**: Men reporting high levels of physical activity experienced **19% fewer** poor physical health days compared to inactive men.

## Additional Significant Findings

### Demographics
- **Age**: IRR = 1.01 per year (95% CI: 1.00-1.01), p < 0.001
  - Each additional year of age associated with 1% increase in poor physical health days

### Health Behaviors
- **Current Smoking**: IRR = 1.36 (95% CI: 1.24-1.49), p < 0.001
  - Current smokers experienced 36% higher rates of poor physical health days
- **Former Smoking**: IRR = 1.08 (95% CI: 1.00-1.16), p = 0.042

### Marital Status
- Married men reported slightly fewer poor physical health days compared to unmarried men
- IRR = 0.95 (95% CI: 0.89-1.01), p = 0.11 (marginally significant)

## Statistical Model Summary

### Model Specification
- **Model Type**: Negative binomial regression with robust standard errors
- **Rationale**: Appropriate for count outcomes with overdispersion
- **Survey Design**: Incorporated NHANES complex survey weights, strata, and primary sampling units

### Model Fit
- The model demonstrated good fit with significant associations across multiple domains
- Wald tests indicated overall model significance
- Variance inflation factors indicated no problematic multicollinearity

## Key Messages for Abstract

1. **Primary Finding**: Among 4,922 older men, multimorbidity showed a strong dose-response relationship with poor physical health days, with men having 3+ chronic conditions experiencing twice the rate of poor physical health days.

2. **Disparities**: Mexican American men had 43% higher rates of poor physical health days than non-Hispanic White men, and socioeconomic disadvantage was associated with significantly worse physical health.

3. **Protective Factor**: High physical activity was associated with 19% fewer poor physical health days, highlighting an important modifiable risk factor.

4. **Public Health Burden**: 14.8% of older men reported 14 or more poor physical health days, representing substantial impairment in health-related quality of life.

## Novel Contributions

1. **Gender-Specific Focus**: One of the few studies specifically examining health-related quality of life determinants among older men

2. **Dose-Response Documentation**: Clear demonstration of progressive increase in poor physical health days with each additional chronic condition

3. **Disparity Persistence**: Evidence that racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities persist even in Medicare-eligible populations

4. **Modifiable Risk Factor Identification**: Strong protective effect of physical activity even after adjustment for chronic conditions

## Implications Summary

**Clinical**: Healthcare providers should assess multimorbidity burden, promote physical activity, and address social determinants when caring for older men.

**Public Health**: Population-level interventions should prioritize chronic disease prevention, physical activity promotion, and health equity initiatives.

**Policy**: Medicare and public health policies should address social determinants and support comprehensive chronic disease management.

**Research**: Future studies should examine longitudinal trajectories, intervention effectiveness, and gender-specific approaches to men's health.
