# Conclusion

This study examined factors associated with poor physical health days among a nationally representative sample of 4,922 older men aged 60 years and older from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2001-2018). The findings provide important insights into the determinants of health-related quality of life in this understudied population and have significant implications for clinical practice and public health policy.

## Main Findings

The primary finding of this study is the robust dose-response relationship between chronic medical conditions and poor physical health days. Men with three or more chronic conditions experienced twice the rate of poor physical health days compared to those without chronic conditions. This finding underscores the substantial burden that multimorbidity places on physical health-related quality of life among older men and highlights the need for comprehensive approaches to chronic disease prevention and management.

Socioeconomic factors, including income and educational attainment, showed strong inverse associations with poor physical health days. Each unit increase in the income-to-poverty ratio was associated with an 8% reduction in the rate of poor physical health days, while men without a high school diploma experienced 18% higher rates compared to those with at least some college education. Notably, these socioeconomic disparities persisted in a Medicare-eligible population, suggesting that health insurance coverage alone is insufficient to eliminate health inequities in later life.

Racial and ethnic disparities remained evident in this older male population, with Mexican American men experiencing 43% higher rates of poor physical health days compared to non-Hispanic White men. This finding highlights the persistence of health inequities even after reaching Medicare eligibility age and underscores the need for continued efforts to address structural and social determinants of health.

Physical activity emerged as a critical protective factor, with men reporting high levels of physical activity experiencing 19% fewer poor physical health days compared to inactive men. This finding reinforces the importance of physical activity promotion for maintaining health-related quality of life in older age and suggests that physical activity may be one of the most actionable intervention targets for improving health outcomes among older men.

Additional significant findings included the adverse effects of current smoking (36% higher rate of poor physical health days) and the positive association between mental health days and physical health days, indicating the interconnected nature of physical and psychological well-being. Overall, 14.8% of older men in the analytic sample reported 14 or more poor physical health days, representing a substantial burden of suboptimal physical health in this population.

## Clinical Implications

The findings of this study have several important implications for clinical practice. Healthcare providers caring for older men should routinely assess multimorbidity burden and its impact on physical health-related quality of life. Rather than focusing exclusively on disease-specific outcomes, clinicians should consider the cumulative impact of multiple chronic conditions on patients' daily functioning and well-being.

Physical activity counseling should be a standard component of care for older men, regardless of chronic disease status. The finding that physical activity remains protective even among those with chronic conditions suggests that exercise prescriptions and referrals to community-based physical activity programs may benefit all older men, including those with existing health problems.

Clinicians should be attentive to social determinants of health, including socioeconomic status and race/ethnicity, when caring for older men. Men from disadvantaged backgrounds may face barriers to optimal health that require tailored approaches to care, including assistance with medication adherence, transportation to appointments, and connections to social services.

Smoking cessation interventions remain important for older men, as current smoking was associated with significantly higher rates of poor physical health days. Healthcare providers should routinely assess smoking status and provide evidence-based cessation support, recognizing that quitting smoking at any age provides health benefits.

The association between mental and physical health days suggests that integrated care approaches addressing both psychological and physical well-being may be beneficial for older men. Screening for depression and anxiety, along with appropriate treatment and referral, should be standard components of care for older men reporting poor physical health.

## Policy Implications

The findings of this study inform several policy recommendations aimed at improving health-related quality of life among older men and reducing health disparities.

Public health initiatives should prioritize chronic disease prevention through population-level interventions targeting modifiable risk factors. Policies supporting healthy food environments, safe spaces for physical activity, and smoke-free environments can help reduce the burden of chronic disease and improve health-related quality of life at the population level.

Efforts to eliminate health disparities must extend beyond health insurance coverage to address the structural and social determinants of health. Policies addressing housing security, food security, income support, and environmental justice may help reduce socioeconomic and racial/ethnic disparities in health among older adults.

Medicare policy should continue to evolve to support comprehensive chronic disease management for beneficiaries with multiple chronic conditions. Payment models that support integrated care, care coordination, and attention to social determinants of health may improve outcomes for older adults with multimorbidity.

Physical activity promotion should be a public health priority for older adults. Policies supporting the creation of age-friendly environments, including safe walking spaces, accessible recreational facilities, and community-based physical activity programs, can help increase physical activity levels among older men.

Research funding should be directed toward understanding and addressing men's health, including the development of gender-specific interventions and approaches to care. The historical underrepresentation of men in health research has limited understanding of factors specific to men's health and well-being.

## Significance and Contribution

This study makes several important contributions to the literature on health-related quality of life among older adults. By focusing specifically on older men, the study addresses a significant gap in the literature and provides insights into factors that may be particularly relevant to men's health. The use of nationally representative data from NHANES enhances the generalizability of the findings to the broader population of older men in the United States.

The demonstration of strong dose-response relationships between chronic conditions, socioeconomic factors, and physical health days provides evidence supporting comprehensive approaches to promoting health and well-being among older men. The identification of physical activity as a key protective factor highlights an actionable intervention target that may benefit older men across diverse demographic groups.

The finding of persistent racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in a Medicare-eligible population challenges assumptions that universal health insurance coverage will automatically eliminate health inequities. This finding underscores the importance of addressing social determinants of health and structural factors that drive health disparities.

Overall, this study advances understanding of health-related quality of life determinants among older men and provides a foundation for future research and intervention development. The findings highlight the complex interplay of biological, behavioral, and social factors influencing physical health in older age and underscore the need for multifaceted approaches to promoting health and well-being among older men.

## Final Statement

The health and well-being of older men is a critical public health concern as the population ages. This study demonstrates that poor physical health days are common among older men and are strongly associated with chronic disease burden, socioeconomic disadvantage, and racial/ethnic minority status. At the same time, the findings identify physical activity as a powerful protective factor that can help maintain health-related quality of life even in the presence of chronic conditions.

Addressing the determinants of poor physical health days among older men will require coordinated efforts across clinical practice, public health, and policy domains. Healthcare providers, public health practitioners, and policymakers must work together to prevent chronic diseases, promote physical activity, eliminate health disparities, and support the health and well-being of all older men. By addressing these challenges, we can help ensure that older men live not only longer but also healthier, more fulfilling lives.

The findings of this study serve as a call to action for researchers, clinicians, and policymakers to prioritize men's health and to develop comprehensive approaches that address the complex factors influencing health-related quality of life in older age. Through sustained commitment to understanding and addressing these challenges, we can improve the health and well-being of older men and contribute to healthier aging for all.
