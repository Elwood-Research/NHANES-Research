## 7. Search Limitations

### Database Limitations
1. Some API searches returned empty results despite valid queries
2. Semantic Scholar and PubMed APIs returned fewer results than expected
3. CrossRef provided the most comprehensive results

### Coverage Limitations
1. May have missed very recent publications (2025-2026)
2. Grey literature and government reports may be underrepresented
3. Non-English publications excluded

### Temporal Limitations
1. Literature search conducted at single time point
2. New publications may have emerged since search date

---

## 8. Key Themes Identified

### Theme 1: CDC Healthy Days Measurement
- Established validity and reliability of CDC Healthy Days measures
- Comparison with longer instruments (SF-36) shows good concordance
- Recommended for population surveillance

### Theme 2: Multimorbidity Impact
- Multiple chronic conditions strongly associated with poor health days
- Distinct multimorbidity patterns have differential impacts
- NHANES studies provide key evidence on multimorbidity in older adults

### Theme 3: Physical Activity Protection
- Consistent evidence for physical activity benefits
- Dose-response relationship documented
- Benefits persist even with chronic conditions

### Theme 4: Health Disparities
- Racial disparities persist in older age
- Socioeconomic status strongly associated with health days
- Intersectional factors require further study

### Theme 5: Gender-Specific Considerations
- Limited research specifically focused on older men
- Men's health disparities underrepresented in literature
- Need for gender-sensitive approaches to healthy aging

---

## 9. Gaps in Literature Identified

1. **Gender-Specific Research**: Limited studies specifically examining older men's health
2. **Intersectionality**: Few studies examining multiple social identities simultaneously
3. **Longitudinal Trajectories**: Most NHANES studies are cross-sectional
4. **Intervention Research**: Limited RCTs testing interventions for older men
5. **Sexual Orientation**: Limited research on sexual minority older men
6. **Rural Health**: Underrepresentation of rural older men in NHANES studies

---

## 10. Recommendations for Future Searches

### Immediate Recommendations
1. Monitor PubMed and Semantic Scholar for additional NHANES publications
2. Search for 2024-2025 publications not yet indexed
3. Identify any updates to CDC Healthy Days methodology

### Long-term Recommendations
1. Set up alerts for new NHANES HRQOL publications
2. Expand search to include BRFSS studies with Healthy Days measures
3. Include Medicare Health Outcomes Survey (HOS) literature
4. Consider international comparators using similar measures
