# Literature Synthesis: Older Men and Physical Health Days

## Executive Summary

This literature review synthesizes evidence on factors associated with poor physical health days among older men (age 60+) in the United States. The review focuses on the CDC Healthy Days measure as a key indicator of health-related quality of life (HRQOL), drawing from NHANES studies and broader epidemiological research. Key themes identified include the burden of chronic disease, health disparities by race and socioeconomic status, the protective role of physical activity, and methodological considerations for measuring health-related quality of life in aging populations.

## 1. Introduction: The Importance of Studying Physical Health Days in Older Men

The aging of the U.S. population has profound implications for public health, with older adults experiencing a disproportionate burden of chronic disease and functional limitations. Older men, in particular, face unique health challenges that warrant specific investigation. While women generally live longer than men, older men experience distinct patterns of morbidity and mortality that affect their quality of life (Verbrugge, 2025). Understanding factors that contribute to poor physical health days among older men is essential for developing targeted interventions to promote healthy aging.

The concept of "healthy days"—days free from physical and mental health problems—provides a patient-centered metric for assessing population health. Unlike traditional mortality-based measures, healthy days capture the lived experience of illness and its impact on daily functioning. This approach aligns with the growing emphasis on patient-reported outcomes and health-related quality of life in public health surveillance and clinical practice (Moriarty et al., 2003).

## 2. The CDC Healthy Days Measure: Background and Validation

### 2.1 Development and Implementation

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) developed the Healthy Days measures in the early 1990s as part of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). The core measure (HRQOL-4) consists of four items assessing:
1. Self-rated general health status
2. Number of days physical health was not good
3. Number of days mental health was not good
4. Number of days with activity limitations

These items have been validated extensively and have been used in numerous population-based surveys, including NHANES (Moriarty et al., 2003; Barile et al., 2012). The CDC Healthy Days measures have demonstrated strong psychometric properties, including test-retest reliability, construct validity, and responsiveness to change (Zullig, 2010).

### 2.2 Measurement Properties

Studies have examined the measurement characteristics of the CDC Healthy Days items relative to longer, more complex instruments such as the SF-36. Barile et al. (2016) found that the CDC Healthy Days items demonstrated good concurrent validity with the SF-36 among older adults, with similar patterns of association across demographic and health status groups. The brevity of the CDC measure makes it particularly suitable for population surveillance and large-scale epidemiologic studies.

The summary index of unhealthy days can be calculated by combining physically and mentally unhealthy days, with a maximum of 30 unhealthy days to account for comorbidity between physical and mental health problems. Research has validated this approach for tracking population health status over time (Zullig, 2010).

## 3. Prevalence of Poor Physical Health Days

### 3.1 Population Estimates

Population-based estimates from NHANES and BRFSS indicate that poor physical health days are common among older adults. Xu et al. (2019) examined age-specific trends in health-related quality of life among U.S. adults using NHANES data from 2001-2016, finding significant increases in reported unhealthy days with advancing age. Adults aged 60 and older reported an average of 6-8 physically unhealthy days per month, with substantial variation by health status and demographic characteristics.

### 3.2 Trends Over Time

Longitudinal analyses suggest that while overall life expectancy has increased, the burden of chronic disease and associated limitations has grown among older adults. Crescioni et al. (2010) documented trends in health status and healthcare use among older men, finding persistent gaps in functional health despite improvements in medical care. The increasing prevalence of multimorbidity—defined as the co-occurrence of two or more chronic conditions—has contributed to this growing burden (Jindai et al., 2016).

## 4. Risk Factors for Poor Physical Health Days

### 4.1 Demographic Factors

**Age**: The relationship between age and physical health days is well-established, with older adults reporting progressively more unhealthy days. However, the rate of increase varies by birth cohort and period effects (Xu et al., 2019).

**Race and Ethnicity**: Racial disparities in health-related quality of life persist among older men. Delgado et al. (2023) examined employment status and mortality among Black men using NHANES III data, documenting significant disparities in health outcomes. Su et al. (2014) found that racial disparities in mortality among middle-aged and older men were partially explained by differences in marital status, socioeconomic factors, and health behaviors.

**Socioeconomic Status**: Income, education, and employment status are strong determinants of health-related quality of life. Lower socioeconomic position is associated with higher rates of chronic disease, functional limitations, and poor self-rated health (Lahti et al., 2024).

### 4.2 Health-Related Factors

**Chronic Disease Burden**: The presence of chronic conditions is the strongest predictor of poor physical health days. Tang and Vasquez (2019) examined cancer prevalence and multimorbidity using NHANES 2011-2016 data, finding that multimorbidity was significantly associated with reduced quality of life. Wang et al. (2017) demonstrated that multimorbidity clusters had differential impacts on health-related quality of life, with cardiovascular-metabolic clusters showing particularly strong associations.

**Physical Activity**: Physical activity is consistently associated with better health-related quality of life. Freelove-Charton et al. (2007) found that older adults meeting physical activity recommendations reported 39-70% fewer unhealthy days compared to inactive adults, even among those with activity limitations. Savela et al. (2010) documented that physical activity at midlife predicted better health-related quality of life in older men.

**Obesity and Weight Status**: Body weight status is associated with onset of functional limitations in middle-aged and older adults. An and Shi (2015) demonstrated that overweight and obesity were significant risk factors for developing activity limitations, with effects persisting across age groups.

## 5. Chronic Disease Impact on Physical Health Days

### 5.1 Multimorbidity Patterns

Chronic disease multimorbidity has emerged as a critical determinant of health-related quality of life in older adults. Jindai et al. (2016) examined multimorbidity and functional limitations among adults 65 and older using NHANES 2005-2012 data, finding strong associations between multiple chronic conditions and reduced physical functioning.

Research has identified distinct patterns of multimorbidity that differentially affect health outcomes:

**Cardiovascular-Metabolic Pattern**: Hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease cluster together and show strong associations with physical limitations and reduced quality of life (Tang & Vasquez, 2019).

**Musculoskeletal Pattern**: Arthritis and related conditions are common in older men and significantly impact physical functioning and health-related quality of life (Freelove-Charton et al., 2007).

**Respiratory Pattern**: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and related conditions contribute to functional decline and poor health days (Chen et al., 2025).

### 5.2 Disease-Specific Impacts

**Cardiovascular Disease**: Heart disease remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among older men, with significant impacts on physical functioning and quality of life. Hipp et al. (2019) found associations between parenthood history and incident heart disease among older adults, highlighting the complex life course factors influencing cardiovascular health.

**Diabetes**: Diabetes mellitus is associated with reduced health-related quality of life through multiple pathways, including direct effects on physical functioning and through complications such as cardiovascular disease and neuropathy.

**Cancer**: Cancer survivorship among older men is associated with persistent decrements in health-related quality of life, even years after initial diagnosis (Tang & Vasquez, 2019).

## 6. Health Disparities in Physical Health Days

### 6.1 Racial and Ethnic Disparities

Health disparities by race and ethnicity are pronounced among older men. Black men experience higher rates of chronic disease, functional limitations, and mortality compared to White men (Delgado et al., 2023; Su et al., 2014). These disparities are rooted in structural racism, differential access to healthcare, and socioeconomic inequality (Thorpe & Whitfield, 2024).

Kindratt et al. (2023) examined sociodemographic disparities in 24-hour movement guideline adherence using NHANES 2017-2020 data, finding significant differences in physical activity patterns by race and ethnicity that contribute to health disparities.

### 6.2 Socioeconomic Disparities

Social mobility and lifetime socioeconomic status are associated with trajectories of health-related quality of life. Lahti et al. (2024) found that declining socioeconomic status during the life course was associated with lower physical health-related quality of life trajectories among older men. Conversely, improving socioeconomic status was potentially as beneficial as high socioeconomic status for later-life health.

### 6.3 Rural-Urban Disparities

Rural older adults face unique challenges related to healthcare access, social isolation, and economic opportunity that may contribute to disparities in health-related quality of life. Research has documented rural-urban differences in chronic disease prevalence and functional status among older adults.

## 7. NHANES Studies on Health-Related Quality of Life

### 7.1 Cross-Sectional Analyses

Numerous studies have utilized NHANES data to examine health-related quality of life in older adults. Xu et al. (2019) conducted comprehensive analyses of age-specific trends in HRQOL using NHANES 2001-2016, documenting significant improvements in some domains but persistent disparities.

Tucker (2017) examined consumption of nuts and seeds and telomere length in NHANES participants, finding associations between dietary factors and biological aging markers that may influence health-related quality of life.

### 7.2 Longitudinal and Linked Analyses

The NHANES Linked Mortality File enables examination of associations between health-related quality of life and long-term mortality outcomes. Delgado et al. (2023) used NHANES III linked mortality data to examine associations between employment status and all-cause mortality among Black men, documenting significant associations between unemployment and mortality risk.

### 7.3 Methodological Contributions

NHANES studies have contributed to methodological advances in measuring and analyzing health-related quality of life. The integration of biological measures with self-reported health data in NHANES has enabled examination of the relationships between objective health indicators and subjective quality of life.

## 8. Protective Factors and Interventions

### 8.1 Physical Activity Interventions

Physical activity is one of the most consistent protective factors for health-related quality of life. Meta-analyses have documented dose-response relationships between physical activity and reduced risk of chronic disease, functional decline, and poor mental health outcomes (Elavsky & McAuley, 2023).

Vallance et al. (2013) examined associations between sitting time and health-related quality of life among older men, finding that sedentary behavior was independently associated with reduced quality of life even after controlling for physical activity.

### 8.2 Social Support and Engagement

Social support and community engagement are associated with better health outcomes among older adults. Emlet et al. (2019) examined health disparities among older gay and bisexual men with and without HIV, finding that social support and resilience were protective factors for physical and mental health.

### 8.3 Healthcare Access and Quality

Access to high-quality healthcare, including preventive services and chronic disease management, is essential for maintaining health-related quality of life in older age. Research has documented associations between healthcare utilization patterns and health outcomes among older adults.

## 9. Gaps in the Literature

### 9.1 Gender-Specific Research

While substantial literature exists on aging and health-related quality of life, relatively few studies have specifically focused on older men as a distinct population. Men's health research has historically been underrepresented compared to women's health research, despite men's shorter life expectancy and distinct patterns of morbidity (Kirby, 2024).

### 9.2 Intersectionality

Limited research has examined how multiple social identities (race, class, gender, sexual orientation) intersect to shape health-related quality of life among older men. Intersectional approaches are needed to understand the diverse experiences of aging men.

### 9.3 Longitudinal Trajectories

Most NHANES studies are cross-sectional, limiting understanding of how health-related quality of life trajectories develop over time and what factors influence these trajectories. Longitudinal research is needed to identify modifiable risk factors and optimal timing for interventions.

### 9.4 Intervention Effectiveness

While observational studies have identified numerous risk and protective factors, randomized controlled trials testing interventions to improve health-related quality of life among older men are relatively scarce.

## 10. Implications for the Current Study

### 10.1 Research Questions

This literature review informs the following research questions for the current NHANES study on older men and physical health days:

1. What are the prevalence and distribution of poor physical health days among older men (age 60+) in the United States?

2. What demographic, socioeconomic, and health-related factors are associated with poor physical health days in this population?

3. How do chronic disease burden and multimorbidity patterns relate to physical health days?

4. What are the relative contributions of modifiable versus non-modifiable risk factors?

### 10.2 Hypotheses

Based on the literature reviewed, we hypothesize that:

1. Older men with higher chronic disease burden will report significantly more poor physical health days.

2. Racial/ethnic minority men will report more poor physical health days compared to non-Hispanic White men.

3. Higher socioeconomic status will be protective against poor physical health days.

4. Physical activity will be inversely associated with poor physical health days, independent of other factors.

### 10.3 Methodological Considerations

The current study will utilize the CDC Healthy Days measures available in NHANES, which provide validated, population-representative data on health-related quality of life. Analytic approaches will account for the complex sampling design of NHANES and will examine interactions between risk factors to identify high-risk subgroups.

## 11. Conclusions

The literature reviewed demonstrates that poor physical health days are common among older men and are associated with a complex array of demographic, socioeconomic, and health-related factors. Chronic disease burden, particularly multimorbidity, emerges as a primary driver of reduced health-related quality of life. Health disparities by race and socioeconomic status persist into older age, reflecting cumulative disadvantage across the life course.

Physical activity represents a key modifiable protective factor, with consistent evidence supporting its benefits for health-related quality of life even among those with chronic conditions and activity limitations. This finding underscores the importance of promoting physical activity across the lifespan and into older age.

The CDC Healthy Days measures provide a valuable tool for assessing health-related quality of life in population-based studies, offering a patient-centered perspective that complements traditional biomedical measures. Continued research using these measures in NHANES and other data sources will advance understanding of factors affecting healthy aging and inform interventions to promote more healthy days for older men.
