# Research Roadmap: Older Men and Physical Health Days

## Timeline

### Phase 1: Literature Review (Days 1-3)
- Search academic databases for relevant studies
- Identify theoretical frameworks
- Compile minimum 20 verified references
- Focus on: NHANES studies, health-related quality of life, aging men's health

### Phase 2: Research Plan (Days 4-5)
- Develop testable hypotheses
- Define study population and exclusions
- Identify confounding variables
- Create analysis plan

### Phase 3: Methods (Days 6-7)
- Finalize variable selection
- Document measurement scales
- Define statistical approach
- Plan sensitivity analyses

### Phase 4: Analysis (Days 8-14)
- Data extraction and merging
- Sample characterization
- Descriptive statistics
- Regression modeling
- Sensitivity analyses
- STROBE diagram creation

### Phase 5: Synthesis (Days 15-16)
- Interpret results
- Compare with literature
- Identify limitations
- Develop conclusions

### Phase 6: Manuscript (Days 17-20)
- Draft all sections
- Create tables and figures
- Compile references
- Format for submission
- Create presentation

### Phase 7: Publication (Day 21)
- Final review
- GitHub publication
