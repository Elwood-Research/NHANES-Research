# Older Men and Physical Health Days: A Cross-Sectional Study

## Research Question
What factors are associated with poor physical health days among older men (age 60+) in the United States, and what is the burden of activity limitation days attributable to physical or mental health conditions in this population?

## Study Objectives

1. **Primary Objective**
   - Examine the prevalence and distribution of poor physical health days among older men (60+ years) in the United States

2. **Secondary Objectives**
   - Identify demographic, socioeconomic, and health-related correlates of poor physical health days
   - Assess the relationship between chronic conditions and activity limitation days
   - Examine the impact of mental health on physical health days in older men
   - Evaluate health disparities across racial/ethnic groups

## Background
Physical health-related quality of life is a critical indicator of population health and healthcare needs. The CDC's Healthy Days measure, which includes the number of days physical health was not good, is widely used to track population health status. Older men face unique health challenges, including higher rates of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and functional limitations, yet there is limited recent comprehensive analysis of the factors driving poor physical health days in this specific demographic.

## Expected Outcomes
- Descriptive statistics on poor physical health days among older men
- Identification of key risk factors for poor physical health days
- Population-level estimates of activity limitations due to health conditions
- Evidence-based recommendations for targeted health interventions

## Study Type
Cross-sectional analysis using NHANES data

## Keywords
NHANES, older men, physical health days, health-related quality of life, health disparities, chronic disease, activity limitations
