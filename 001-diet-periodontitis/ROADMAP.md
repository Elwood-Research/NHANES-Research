# Roadmap

## Phase 1: Literature
- Identify mechanistic links between diet/nutrients and periodontal inflammation
- Identify prior NHANES periodontitis-diet analyses and typical covariate sets

## Phase 2: Research plan
- Specify primary hypotheses and contrasts (e.g., per SD increase; quartiles)
- Define primary analytic sample (age eligibility, exam completion)

## Phase 3: Methods
- Define periodontitis outcome(s) (status code and/or CDC/AAP-derived case definitions)
- Define exposure operationalization (day-1 totals; optional 2-day average)
- Define confounding structure and model sequence

## Phase 4: Analysis
- Build analytic dataset inside the vault container
- Apply outlier and small-cell exclusions with STROBE accounting
- Fit survey-weighted regression models and generate tables/figures

## Phase 5: Synthesis + Manuscript + Presentation
- Interpret findings with limitations (cross-sectional, measurement error)
- Produce 8-12 page manuscript and 10-13 slide deck
