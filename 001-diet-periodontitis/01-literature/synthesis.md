# Literature Synthesis: Dietary Nutrient Intake and Periodontitis

## Introduction
Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease affecting the supporting structures of the teeth. While oral hygiene and smoking are well-established risk factors, emerging evidence suggests that diet plays a significant modulatory role in periodontal health. This synthesis reviews recent literature, primarily using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), to examine the associations between specific dietary nutrients—including sugars, fiber, and micronutrients—and periodontitis.

## Macronutrients: Sugars and Fiber
Dietary sugars, particularly from sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), have been consistently linked to adverse periodontal outcomes. Alves-Costa et al. (2024) found that higher SSB consumption was associated with increased odds of periodontitis in a dose-dependent manner. Similarly, Mendelian randomization and observational analyses by Chen et al. (2025) reinforced that sugar intake is a causal risk factor. Conversely, dietary fiber has demonstrated a protective effect. Nielsen et al. (2016) and Chuai et al. (2023) reported inverse associations between fiber intake and periodontal attachment loss, suggesting that high-fiber diets may mitigate periodontal inflammation, potentially through glycemic control or prebiotic effects. However, the role of ultra-processed foods, often high in sugar and low in fiber, remains debated, with Bidinotto et al. (2021) finding no direct association after adjusting for confounders.

## Micronutrients and Antioxidants
Micronutrients play a crucial role in maintaining periodontal tissue integrity and modulating immune responses.
*   **Vitamin C:** Li et al. (2022) identified a threshold nonlinear association where adequate vitamin C intake was protective against periodontitis.
*   **Magnesium:** Multiple studies (Wu et al. 2024; Li et al. 2022b; Huang et al. 2025) consistently show that dietary magnesium intake is inversely associated with periodontitis prevalence, particularly in non-obese populations.
*   **Calcium and Vitamin D:** Cao et al. (2025) found that elevated serum calcium levels were associated with reduced risk, and Liang et al. (2024) highlighted the joint protective effects of multiple vitamins, including D and calcium.
*   **Vitamin K:** Recent evidence from Zhu et al. (2025) and Chuai et al. (2023) suggests Vitamin K intake is also inversely associated with disease progression.
*   **Antioxidants:** Chen et al. (2025) developed a composite dietary antioxidant index (CDAI) and found that higher aggregate antioxidant intake was significantly associated with lower periodontitis prevalence.

## Dietary Patterns and Novel Factors
Beyond single nutrients, overall dietary patterns are critical. Wright et al. (2020) identified a "salad, fruit, and vegetables" pattern as significantly protective. A systematic review by Shi et al. (2024) confirmed that higher diet quality scores (e.g., Healthy Eating Index) correlate with better periodontal health. Novel dietary factors are also emerging; Gong et al. (2025) reported a U-shaped relationship with dietary live microbe intake, and Zhou et al. (2025) suggested theobromine (found in cocoa/tea) might be protective.

## Conclusion
The literature strongly supports the hypothesis that dietary quality influences periodontal health. High intakes of pro-inflammatory components like added sugars correlate with disease, while anti-inflammatory nutrients (fiber, antioxidants, magnesium, vitamins C/D/K) and healthy dietary patterns appear protective. These findings underscore the potential for dietary interventions in periodontitis prevention and management.
