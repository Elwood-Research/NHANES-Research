# Project: Dietary nutrient intake and periodontitis in U.S. adults (NHANES)

**Status**: Initialization
**Date**: 2026-02-07
**Study Slug**: diet-periodontitis-2026-02-07

## Research Question
Among U.S. adults, are dietary nutrient intakes (higher sugars and lower fiber / micronutrient intake) associated with the prevalence and severity of periodontitis?

## Cycle Strategy
- **Mode**: all-available-years
- **Notes**: Use all eligible NHANES years with required variables and documentation; periodontal exam availability will likely constrain eligible cycles.

## Candidate Exposures
- Total sugars intake (g/day; 24-hour dietary recall totals)
- Dietary fiber intake (g/day; 24-hour dietary recall totals)
- Vitamin C intake (mg/day; 24-hour dietary recall totals)
- Calcium intake (mg/day; 24-hour dietary recall totals)

## Candidate Outcomes
- Periodontitis status / severity from full-mouth periodontal examination (clinical attachment loss and probing depth)
- NHANES periodontal status code (exam-derived categorical status indicator)

## Required Covariates
- age
- sex
- race/ethnicity
- education
- income-to-poverty ratio
- body mass index
- smoking status
- diabetes status
- alcohol use
- physical activity
- total energy intake (kcal/day)
- oral hygiene / dental care utilization (time since dental visit; teeth cleaning recency; flossing frequency)
- tooth retention / number of teeth present

## Quality Targets
- Min total citations: 20
- Min verified NHANES/high-impact: 15
- Manuscript pages: 15-20
- Presentation slides: 10-13
