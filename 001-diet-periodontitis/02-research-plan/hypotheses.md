# Hypotheses

## Primary Hypotheses

### H1: Total Sugars Intake
- **Null Hypothesis ($H_0$):** There is no association between total dietary sugar intake and the prevalence or severity of periodontitis in U.S. adults.
- **Alternative Hypothesis ($H_1$):** Higher total dietary sugar intake is positively associated with the prevalence and severity of periodontitis, independent of potential confounders.

### H2: Dietary Fiber Intake
- **Null Hypothesis ($H_0$):** There is no association between dietary fiber intake and the prevalence or severity of periodontitis.
- **Alternative Hypothesis ($H_1$):** Higher dietary fiber intake is inversely associated with the prevalence and severity of periodontitis (protective effect).

## Secondary Hypotheses: Micronutrients

### H3: Vitamin C Intake
- **Null Hypothesis ($H_0$):** There is no association between Vitamin C intake and periodontitis status.
- **Alternative Hypothesis ($H_1$):** Higher Vitamin C intake is inversely associated with the odds of periodontitis.

### H4: Calcium Intake
- **Null Hypothesis ($H_0$):** There is no association between Calcium intake and periodontitis status.
- **Alternative Hypothesis ($H_1$):** Higher Calcium intake is inversely associated with the odds of periodontitis.

## Mechanism
- **Sugars:** High sugar intake may promote systemic inflammation and oral bacterial dysbiosis (biofilm formation), contributing to periodontal tissue destruction.
- **Fiber:** High fiber intake may improve glycemic control (reducing inflammation) and often reflects a diet rich in anti-inflammatory plant foods.
- **Micronutrients (Vit C, Ca):** 
    - **Vitamin C:** Essential for collagen synthesis and antioxidant defense; deficiency compromises gingival tissue integrity.
    - **Calcium:** Essential for alveolar bone maintenance; low intake may exacerbate bone loss associated with periodontitis.
